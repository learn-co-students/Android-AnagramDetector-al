# Anagram Detector

## Instructions

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams,
selects the correct one(s).

Your class, `Anagram` should take a word, and a String Array on initialization, and instances should
respond to a `match` method. It should return
all matches in an array. If no matches exist, it should return an empty array.

In other words, given: `"listen"` and `{"enlists", "google", "inlets", "banana"}`
the program should return `{"inlets"}`.


Write your solution in Anagram.java. Run the tests with `AnagramTests`.
